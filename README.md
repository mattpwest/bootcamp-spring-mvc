# Spring MVC Exercises

These are the practical exercises for the Spring MVC module of the Entelect Graduate
Bootcamp 2018. This will take you all the way from a simple command line application
through a basic MVC web application all the way to a simple REST API for driving
your web pages.

You have been provided with a basic Spring Boot command-line application that
contains a service which collects information about which superheroes are owned
by which publisher. The CLI application uses this service to produce a simple
numerical report, which you can see by running the CLI application.

Over the course of these exercises you will convert the existing functionality
to a web application and then begin adding new functionality.

Begin by checking out the branch `exercise1` with `git checkout exercise1`.
